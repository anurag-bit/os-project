> [!WARNING]
> THIS IS PROJECT IS UNDER INITIAL DEVELOPEMENT. BUILDS OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM WILL BE HIGH UNSTABLE AND FUNCTIONALLY UNUSABLE,
> TRY THINGS ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING! BACKGROUND WITH OS-PRINCIPLES, WRITING KERNELS/BOOTLOADER OR FILE SYSTEMS IS HIGHLY RECOMMMENDED! 


### Project Overview

This project is focused on building a custom operating system (OS) from scratch. It encompasses all aspects of OS development, from designing the kernel and bootloader to implementing a file system and other essential components.

### Project Structure

- **Kernel:** This directory contains the core of the operating system. It's responsible for handling hardware, managing processes, and providing system calls. You'll find detailed information on how to build and extend the kernel in its own README within the directory.

- **Bootloader:** The bootloader is the initial program that loads the OS into memory and starts its execution. You can find instructions and information on building and customizing the bootloader in this directory.

- **File System:** A file system is crucial for data storage and retrieval. Documentation on building a file system and handling file operations can be found in this directory.

- **User Applications:** This directory contains examples of user-space applications that can be run on the OS once it's operational.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- [List your prerequisites here, including the development environment, tools, and dependencies.]

### Building and Running the OS

To build and run the OS on your system, follow these general steps:

1. **Kernel:** [Provide instructions for building and running the kernel. Include compilation commands and any specific steps required.]

2. **Bootloader:** [Include instructions for building the bootloader and integrating it with the kernel. Explain how to create a bootable image.]

3. **File System:** [Document the steps to build and integrate the file system with the kernel. Describe file system initialization and usage.]

### Documentation

For detailed information on each component of the OS, refer to the documentation provided in the respective directories:

- [Link to Kernel Documentation] -> YET TO COME 
- [Link to Bootloader Documentation] -> YET TO COME
- [Link to File System Documentation](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/networking_communications/SD/FAT.pdf)

### Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project. If you'd like to help improve the OS or add new features, please follow our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
